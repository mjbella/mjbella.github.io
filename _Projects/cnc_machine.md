# About
I was able to rescue some of the main parts for this mill from an old coworker's garrage. I got the XY Stage and the frame
from him about 10 years ago. I added in a Z-axis from [Velox CNC](http://www.veloxcnc.com/ "Velox CNC") with motors and drivers from [Probotix](http://www.probotix.com/ "Probotix").
