title: High Intensity LED Flasher
---

## Background
LEDs can handle a high peak current for a short duration provided that the average power dissipation stays low enough. 

## About
I am using the typical design for this sort of LED flasher (schematic 1). A capacitor bank is charged through a resistor or constant current
source then the LED is switched across the cap with a series resistor to limit the peak current.
